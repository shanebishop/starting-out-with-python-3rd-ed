'''
Write a program that asks the user for a number in the
range of 1 through 7. The program should display the
corresponding day of the week, where 1 = Monday, 2 =
Tuesday, 3 = Wednesday, 4 = Thursday, 5 = Friday, 6 =
Saturday, and 7 = Sunday. The program should display an
error message if the user enters a number that is
outside the range of 1 through 7.
