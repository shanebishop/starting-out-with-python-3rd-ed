Solutions to some exercises from [*Starting Out with Python* 3rd ed.](https://www.amazon.com/Starting-Out-Python-Tony-Gaddis/dp/0133582736/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=starting+out+with+python+3rd+edition+by+tony+gaddis&qid=1641744483&sprefix=starting+out+with+python+3rd%2Caps%2C59&sr=8-1)

Of particular note is the Chapter 8 Exercise 8 solution, as it was the most advanced
exercise in the book, and because it showcases some functions from Python's built-in
[`re` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html).
